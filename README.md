## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Here are the insights and recommendations derived from the analysis:

1. Key Metrics Analysis
Insights:
Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) and Occupancy %: As RevPAR increases, Occupancy % also increases.
Average Daily Rate (ADR): ADR remains constant at ₹12,793. This indicates that the hotel employs flat pricing rather than dynamic or weekday/weekend pricing. The ADR for weekdays is ₹12,799.54, and for weekends, it is ₹12,781.07, showing minimal variation.
Occupancy vs. Rates: There is an inverse relationship between rates and occupancy; as rates increase, occupancy decreases.

Recommendations:
Implement a weekend/weekday pricing strategy for leisure hotels to capitalize on varying demand patterns.
Consider dynamic pricing strategies to better match supply with demand and potentially increase both occupancy and RevPAR.

2. Property Performance by Key Metrics
Insights:
There is a strong correlation between occupancy rates (ranging from 44.33% to 66.3%) and ratings (ranging from 4.31 to 2.13). Higher occupancy rates tend to be associated with better ratings.
Cancellation Rates: High cancellation rates are observed, with the highest at 28.25% and the lowest at 18.13%.

Recommendations:
Investigate customer reviews and ratings to understand and address service quality issues.
Ensure online content accurately represents the hotel's offerings to reduce discrepancies and subsequent cancellations.
Regularly update online content to reflect any new room categories or amenities to provide customers with accurate information.

3. Pricing Strategy by Booking Platform
Insights:
ADR by Booking Platform: The ADR for direct offline bookings is ₹12,793, while for direct online bookings it is ₹12,638, indicating nearly identical pricing across channels.

Recommendations:
Maintain uniform public pricing across all channels to avoid detection and penalization by bots that scrape prices.
Utilize promotions instead of direct pricing differences. Offer additional discount coupons (e.g., 5%) for bookings made through the hotel's own website. This can ensure public prices remain consistent while still providing an incentive for direct bookings.
Use discount codes on the checkout page to avoid bots detecting lower prices on your channel.

Conclusion:
By implementing these recommendations, AtliQ Grands can improve its pricing strategy, enhance customer satisfaction, and potentially increase its market share and revenue. The strategic use of data insights can guide effective decision-making and help the hotel chain regain its competitive edge in the luxury/business hotel market.
